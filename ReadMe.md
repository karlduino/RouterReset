### Router Reset

[Karlduino](http://github.com/karlduino)

The aim of this project is to sense that the internet connection over
wifi is working. If it's not, shut off the router and turn it back on
again.

There's a version for the [Arduino Leonardo](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardLeonardo)
or [Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) with the
[Arduino WiFi Shield](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoWiFiShield)
(actually two: one using the SD card to write a log file and another
playing a tone on a speaker),
and a version for the [Arduino Yun](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardYun).
